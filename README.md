# ChocoStore

ChocoStore is an shopping cart app built using only HTML, Vanilla CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, to practice core concepts of the language.

It was made following a [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-a-shopping-cart-with-javascript/), and adapting the code to particular needs and tastes.
